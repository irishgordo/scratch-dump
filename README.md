# Scratch

this is really just a place to help toss stuff
it's generally safer as it's more redundant since it's not local

this helps avoid the chaos of really strange rebases

this helps avoid the chaos of accidentally not being prepared with doing a git force push to remain pure with single commit

this helps avoid the chaos of constantly juggling git stash saves or pops
